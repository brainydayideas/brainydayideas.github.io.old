      <description>A few years ago, while searching for an alternative to Girl Scouts, we came across DIY.org. DIY is an online community for school-aged kids, where they can complete challenges centered around dozens of skills.

For a few dollars, you can purchase an embroidered hexagonal patch for any skill where your child has earned a patch.</description>
