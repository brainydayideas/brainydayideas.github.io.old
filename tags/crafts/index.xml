      <description>If you grew up in the 80s or 90s, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with Perler beads already. Growing up, we called them Perler beads, but they seem to go by many other different names now too, such as Hana beads, fuse beads, and melty beads. I bought a big bucket of them for my daughters about a year ago.
