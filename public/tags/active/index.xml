      <description>My husband and I got into geocaching in 2006, a few years before our oldest was born. Since it&amp;rsquo;s one of our favorite hobbies, our kids have been going along with us on geocaching outings their entire lives. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with it, geocaching is an outdoor activity, where you use a GPS device (or smartphone app) to find hidden containers. The containers are called geocaches, and we&amp;rsquo;ve seen ones that range in size from less than half an inch tall to as large as a storage trunk.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, while searching for an alternative to Girl Scouts, we came across DIY.org. DIY is an online community for school-aged kids, where they can complete challenges centered around dozens of skills. Once they complete 3 or more challenges within a particular skill category, they earn a patch. DIY itself is free (awesome!), and the pride of earning a virtual patch is a reward in itself. For a few dollars, you can purchase an embroidered hexagonal patch for any skill where your child has earned a patch.</description>
