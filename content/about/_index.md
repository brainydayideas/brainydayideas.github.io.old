Brainy Day Ideas was created as a place where I could keep track of - and share - some of the fun activities my kids enjoy. Having a go-to list of fun, engaging activities, crafts, and games helps me come up with an idea on the spot, rather than falling back to an old stand-by. 

All of the ideas and activities here are ones that I think get their brains working in some way, for example through math, science, art, music, or spatial reasoning. I hope it gives you some inspiration on those rainy days, or any days, when you're looking for something to suggest to your kids!
