title: "DIY.org - New Skills, Patches, and Internet Citizenship"
---

A few years ago, while searching for an alternative to Girl Scouts, we came across [DIY.org](https://www.diy.org). DIY is an online community for school-aged kids, where they can complete challenges centered around dozens of skills. Once they complete 3 or more challenges within a particular skill category, they earn a patch. DIY itself is free (awesome!), and the pride of earning a virtual patch is a reward in itself. For a few dollars, you can purchase an [embroidered hexagonal patch](https://market.diy.org/) for any skill where your child has earned a patch. When our youngest child got her first patch in the mail, she was so overwhelmed with excitement and pride that she burst into tears! 

The skill categories range from outdoorsy (Camper and Geologist) to artsy (Cartoonist and Musician) to techy (Cryptographer and Web Designer) to wacky (Chiller, Grown Up, Tape Ninja). As you probably figured from the name, the idea is for the kids to complete the challenges on their own. Depending on the specific challenge, the kid will usually upload either pictures or video of what they've done, and their submission gets reviewed and approved by the DIY team. 

Once a challenge is approved, other kids can view it and favorite it or leave comments. This is one of the aspects of DIY that I love the most. It teaches kids how to interact appropriately in an online community in a safe, age-appropriate setting. Our kids' eyes light up when they see that they've gotten new favorites or comments on their challenges, and sometimes they'll sign on for the sole purpose of checking out what other kids have created and leaving comments for them. It's led to some great conversations at our house about internet safety and etiquette.

The DIY website positions itself as targeted to kids aged 6-16. Some of the projects are very doable for any age in that range, while others are more advanced and better suited for older kids and teens. For this reason, we sometimes have to help guide our kids (ages 5 and 8) toward challenges that are realistic for them to complete on their own. I love knowing that they'll continue having challenges they can work on for years to come.

One of my favorite challenges my older daughter has completed was the [Create LEGO® Pixel Art](https://diy.org/skills/legomaster/challenges/1691/create-lego-pixel-art) challenge under the [LEGO® Master](https://diy.org/skills/legomaster) skill. She carefully drew a grid on a printed picture of Van Gogh's Starry Night and then spent _months_ carefully creating a LEGO version of it. We still have it displayed in our home, because she was so proud of her hard work.

DIY has been a sanity-saver on rainy days or days when the kids are _"soooooo bored"_. Bringing it back to my original goal of finding a scouts alternative, there's even a [Club Member](https://diy.org/skills/clubmember) skill focused around creating a real-life DIY club where they can recruit other members and work on projects together! If your kids sign up for DIY, come back and share what some of their favorite challenges are.
