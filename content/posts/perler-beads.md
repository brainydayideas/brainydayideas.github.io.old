If you grew up in the 80s or 90s, there's a good chance you're familiar with Perler beads already. Growing up, we called them Perler beads, but they seem to go by many other different names now too, such as Hana beads, fuse beads, and melty beads. I bought a big bucket of them for my daughters about a year ago. If I'm being honest, I bought them for my own enjoyment as much as for the kids, and they have led to countless hours of fun as the girls sift and sort through the beads to find just the right colors and carefully place each one.

If you're not familiar with them, the beads are tiny, hollow, plastic cylinders. They come in all kinds of colors. You place them on peg boards, kind of like pixel art, and they form a picture. Once you have the beads in place, you put a special piece of ironing paper over top of the beads on the peg board and carefully apply pressure with a hot iron to melt the beads enough that they fuse together. Then, once it's cool enough to touch, you remove the fused beads, flip them over, place the paper again and iron the back side. It only takes a couple minutes, and then your creation is ready! We have an adult do the ironing at our house.

When the girls first started out, we got a [big bucket of 11,000 multi-colored beads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YM0H0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0002YM0H0&linkCode=as2&tag=brainydayidea-20&linkId=c2b0ea32c4f573e861c859bfb6eb4937) and a pack of [different shaped peg boards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EHYGNC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004EHYGNC&linkCode=as2&tag=brainydayidea-20&linkId=553c507a059e2e3bccfa2410bb392748), including a circle, heart, star, hexagon and square. We still haven't used all those beads even after they've made dozens and dozens of perler bead creations, so a little goes a long way. 

Depending on their mood, sometimes the kids will do freestyle creations, coming up with a pattern or design on the fly. But often, they'll hop on the computer and use Google Image Search for perler bead patterns for whatever they want to create. There was a span of time where they were making [Minecraft-themed perler bead creations](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1550&bih=690&ei=DTW1W-zcCcuZ_QaSybXYBg&q=perler+bead+patterns+minecraft), for example.

A few tips that have made the process even more fun at our house:

* Find the beads you need in all the colors you plan to use before starting the project. Alternatively, pair up and have one person finding the beads while the other is placing them on the peg boards.
* If you lose or run out of the ironing paper that comes with your initial set of beads or peg boards, parchment paper works well. Don't use wax paper, though, as it can melt on your iron.
* If you have a large enough piece of transfer paper or parchment paper, you can line up a few completed peg boards side by side and iron them all at once. This saved a ton of time for us when one of my daughters made 25 Perler bead creations for a school project.

We're always looking for inspiration for new projects. If your kids have made something really cool with Perler beads, we'd love to hear about it!
